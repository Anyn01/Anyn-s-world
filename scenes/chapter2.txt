*page_break Chapter 2: Echoes

The corridor flickers with dying light as you take another step forward. There’s a sound—faint, metallic, repeating—almost like a heartbeat encoded in wires.

"You're not supposed to be here," a voice murmurs from the static.

*choice
  #Keep walking toward the sound.
    The sound grows louder, sharper. Each step feels heavier.
    *goto found_console
  #Look around for the source of the voice.
    You pause. The corridor stretches endlessly, but a shadow shifts to your right.
    *goto shadow_form
  #Say nothing and remain still.
    Silence thickens. Even the machines seem to hold their breath.
    *goto frozen_path

*label found_console
A terminal flickers into view on the wall. It pulses—waiting.

*choice
  #Touch the console.
    As you place your hand on it, it scans your fingerprint.
    *set memory +5
    *goto unlock_memory
  #Try to bypass the system manually.
    You kneel and begin working on the panel's wiring.
    *set system_integrity -10
    *goto override_attempt
  #Leave it alone.
    You decide not to risk it. There may be more answers elsewhere.
    *goto end_ch2

*label shadow_form
Something steps forward. Not human—its voice, however, sounds... familiar.

"You once promised to shut me down. Will you still?"

*choice
  #"Who are you?"
    "I am a fragment. Of you. Of them."
    *goto end_ch2
  #"Yes, if you're a threat."
    "Then you haven’t changed..."
    *set trust -10
    *goto end_ch2
  #"No. I remember now."
    The figure bows its head. "Then we continue together."
    *set trust +10
    *goto end_ch2

*label frozen_path
The longer you stay still, the more distant the world becomes. Something is watching you.

*choice
  #Force yourself to move.
    Your limbs resist, but you break through.
    *set system_integrity -5
    *goto found_console
  #Stay still longer.
    Something slithers behind your thoughts…
    *goto end_ch2

*label unlock_memory
Memory recovered: The name *Anyn* wasn’t chosen—it was assigned. But it still feels like yours.

*set memory +5
*goto end_ch2

*label override_attempt
The system sparks. Access denied, but the console flashes a single word: "echo."

*set memory +3
*goto end_ch2
